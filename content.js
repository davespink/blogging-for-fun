    "teaser": "Just cant",
    "content": "<p>Well, first off I have to admit that I can't tune a piano. Number one obstacle being that I don't own a piano, nor do I know anyone who does who would be foolish enough to let me try. Nor do I have the tools to do it, like a tuning fork, ( always something new to buy ;-) )<br> or that Allen key with a tommy bar on the top, plus all the felt needed to replace any that's missing, or the little wooden hammers, or the glue. All could be remedied by a quick tap on Amazon, and a short wait.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>More importantly, I don't have the know how, or the skill to tune a piano.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>When I was a lad, piano tuning was quite a thing, we were at the tail end of the piano revolution when the height of Victorian status was an upright in the parlor. ( snigger, cough, sorry ). You couldn't find a piano tuner easy enough, unless you lived in the sticks, and our local man, just up the road was Mr. Wooten. Now, Mr. Wooten was very old, and his wife not so much. I didn't know much about him, except he was locally famous for something ( maybe he played back in the day ) before he went blind? Piano tuners were frequently blind people, or am I making that bit up? Anyway, thing was that Mrs. Wooten only had one hand. The other was a split hook that opened and closed, and it scared me, as she worked in the local shop and I had to go errands there.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Well, Mr. Wooten arrived with his bag of tricks and gave our old Joanna a good servicing .. so to speak, as he couldn't give her a \"seeing to\" , if you get my drift.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I watched him with interest, I remember. This was something you didn't see every day. It seemed to take a long enough time, and I still have the distant memory, but to get back to the original question, the answer is that it's impossible. To tune a piano.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>\"Wait , wait ,wait\", I hear you cry, how come people are paying good money to someone to do the impossible, which would be a paradox anyway. If it's just a matter of hitting the right frequency then surely there's an app for that nowadays. And true enough. Although hitting the right frequency is not the problem. It's that \"yee canny change the laws of physics, Captain\", and this falls into the \"stem subjects basket\".</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I'll now do my best to explain. ( Or go look on Wikipedia for yourself ).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Imagine a piece of string, or catgut, or wire or whatever. If you stretch it like in a guitar, violin, or piano, and pluck it, bow it, or hit it with a mallet, it will make a sound. This has been know for a few years now. Scientists believe its due to vibration of the string and indeed, harmonic motion is a well plowed row.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Now it you take a sting half as long it will vibrate at a frequency twice as high. That's know as a octave, for reasons which are quite ironic, as you'll see later.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Humans, ( and many pets ) find this a pleasing harmonic as the notes don't beat on again the other. If two notes are \"out of tune\", it can sound quite awful and you can hear a \"beat\" depending on how they differ. That's how Mr. Wooten would have found his first note, by striking a tuning fork and listening for the beats while tickling the Allen key to get the string to the right pitch. Armed with one correct note the octaves could be tuned with reference to that note, or by the fork. So far, so good.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Now let's think about the circle of fifths. A perfect fifth from C gets you to G. And a perfect fifth sounds very nice, just tune away the beats and you get the perfect fifth. So now carry from G. The next up is D. G to D is a perfect fifth. D to A, and so on, A to E and so on and that will bring us back to Doe. Or should I say \"Doh!:, because it doesn't. It's slightly out. So when you get back to C and test it against where you stated it's not an exact number of octaves away.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The piano will have been tuned in \"just temperament\", and it should sound vey pleasing, except it will only play in the key of C. So if you don't want more than one key signature, go for it. Problem comes when you play a duet with the person next door who has his or her instrument tuned in a different key.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In years back , like when people wore tall wigs, they would have a \"box of viols\" like little pianos tuned to different keys. Quite impractical.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Someone, at some time, invented the piano, and with it \"equal tempering\", which was a big thing. Bach even wrote a bit of music about it. The modern era began.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>So, what is a \"well tempered clavier\"?</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>It's a compromise , so that each note is a bit out making 12 equally spaced sounds, 11 of them a bit out. To get the frequency of the next note up, multiply the current note by the 12th root of 2 ( think about it ).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>I would have imagined Mr. Wooten would have used his skill and judgement to make the piano sound \"sweet\", and indeed there were guidelines as to how to achieve this avoiding the \"wolf frequencies\", so that there was even more of a compromise, the 12 keys would not be equally spaced, so that the \"common keys\" might sound sweeter.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>A guitar player has a similar dilemma. So you may see them twigling the machine head for their next song to \"drop the fifth\" a shade to make the country music sound better. ( I actually do like a lot of country music , which drops my music cred like a hot brick).</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>A violinist can laugh at them as the violin has no frets, and the player wobbles their left hand anyway.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Brass instruments can be tuned, but valves give the piano problem, except the trombone, it has a slider.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Electronic music can \"do anything\", as can the human voice, which<br>is why a choir sounds so angelic.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Now I've written enough, but there's still a lot to say. Maybe in a future post.<br>Give this a viddy, then go tune something.</p>",

    "headline": "Hueavos Motuleños ",
    "teaser": "From motul",
    "content": "Any time we are passing Motul in the morning we almost always fail to pass it and instead turn off the carretera and go into the town. Motul is a fair sized small market town of 34,000 or so souls and worth a stop for its market, church, San Juan Bautist, and a small cenote on the edge of town. Apart from that though it’s the home of the famous dish eggs Motuleños, and the gold standard is to go to the food hall above the municipal market 20th November and head to concina Doña Evelia. I have no idea if the lady is still there, but the place is always packed when I go, and we have to wait 10 minutes or so for a table. I’d estimate there are maybe 200 chairs, so it must be doing good business. I don’t think there any choice other than “how many eggs?” and “how do want them cooked?”. So if you don’t like Motuleños don’t bother going.\n\nThe version there is what I would say is the basic reference. I’ve not actually watched the preparation close up, but from the taste and making them myself at home I can say it contains the following.\n\nTostadas with black beans spread on top.\nTomatoes fried with onions and garlic, plus a charred and stewed chile habanero.\nTinned processed peas,\nFried platano macho.\nFried eggs\nCilantro\nsalt.\n\nOn this basis, at home, I may add chopped ham, and grated cheese, depending how I feel.\n\nThe dish is available most restaurants in Yucatan can whip one up and it’s usually very good.\nIn Mérida I like Puruxón Cauich in Francisco Montejo.They do a few variations, but I alwasy get\nMotuleños divorciados, green and red tomatoes.\n\nThere’s also a branch in Copules but it’s not so good as the Francisco Montejo one..",

    "headline": "Come back little Sheba",
    "teaser": "Exploring offstage characters in literature and media",
    "content": "\n          <p>In an earlier post I alluded to the names of our border collie dogs, the senior of which is Sheba. She was so named after an old dog of my mother’s, but in turn this dog was named for a Hollywood Movie “Come Back, Little Sheba”. Sheba disappears months before the start of the film and never appears. It is implied that Sheba is presumed dead. It stars Burt Lancaster, and Shirley Booth, who got a Best Actress Oscar in 1953 for it. I began to wonder if there is a term for such characters and yes Gemini informed me thus:</p>\n          <p>Yes, there is! That type of character is called an offstage character or an unseen character.</p>\n          <p>These characters are important to the plot and the development of other characters, even though the audience never actually sees them. They might be mentioned in dialogue, have actions attributed to them, or even influence the events of the play.</p>\n          <p>Here are some examples of famous offstage characters:</p>\n          <p>Godot in “Waiting for Godot”: The title character is the most famous example of an offstage character, whose unseen presence drives the entire play.</p>\n          <p>Mr. Wickham’s father in “Pride and Prejudice”: While the character of Mr. Wickham is onstage, his father, who worked for Mr. Darcy’s father, is only mentioned in dialogue. However, the elder Mr. Wickham’s past relationship with the Darcy family is crucial to understanding Wickham’s motivations.</p>\n          <p>Rose’s fiancé in “The Importance of Being Earnest”: Though never seen, Cecily’s imaginary betrothed, Ernest, plays a significant role in the comedic plot.</p>\n          <p>Offstage characters can serve a variety of purposes, such as:</p>\n          <img src=\"https://w3schools.com/w3images/lights.jpg\" style=\"width:30%; float: left; margin-right: 15px;\">\n          <p>Creating intrigue and suspense: The audience might wonder about their identity or motivations.</p>\n          <p>Developing other characters: Interactions with or discussions about the unseen character can reveal traits and motivations of the onstage characters.</p>\n          <p>Advancing the plot: Their actions, though offstage, can drive the events of the play.</p>\n          <p>Now as to Godot, it is a reworking by Samuel Beckett of his original work in French En attendant Godot.</p>\n          <p>It is alleged that originally Godot was meant to appear halfway through the play, but the actor playing Godot failed to appear and so the two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, were left to adlib the rest of the play. True? I doubt it but I would love it to be so.</p>\n          <p>Adding to the AI effort I can think of Mr Papadopoulos, in Coronation Street who is referred to by Mr Swindley (Arthur Lowe). Papadopoulos is a Greek clothing magnate who owns Miami Modes. Swindley is the manager.</p>\n          <p>Again Arthur Lowe in Dad’s Army, Mrs Mannering is never seen.</p>\n          <p>Google gives us:</p>\n          <p>King Laius in Oedipus Rex: An offstage character in Sophocles’s play who is a driving force for action.</p>\n          <p>Jason’s bride in Medea: An offstage character in Euripides’s play.</p>\n          <p>Rosaline in Romeo and Juliet: An offstage character in Shakespeare’s play who highlights the predicament of the two lovers.</p>\n          <p>Offstage characters also exist in books (again AI gives us):</p>\n          <p>Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird”: Boo is a recluse who never leaves his house, but his presence looms large over the novel. He becomes a source of fascination and fear for the children, and his actions ultimately save Jem and Scout.</p>\n          <p>Mrs. Haverford in “Rebecca”: The deceased first wife of Maxim de Winter, Rebecca is a powerful offstage character whose presence haunts the narrator and Manderley. Her influence shapes the entire plot, even though she is already dead.</p>\n          <p>Snape’s mother in the “Harry Potter” series: Eileen Prince, Severus Snape’s mother, is only mentioned in passing and through memories, but her difficult relationship with his father and her magical abilities are crucial to understanding Snape’s character and motivations.</p>\n          <p>I would add that in 1984 O’Brien plays a major part in the narrative, but it is unsure that he actually exists.</p>\n          <p>For most of Atlas Shrugged we are unsure if John Galt exists, even though he drives the plot. (Yes, he appears, after a few 1000 pages 😉).</p>\n          <p>That’s about it, but if you can think of any I’ve missed please leave a comment. Ta.</p>\n        ",

    "teaser": "Reflecting on AI and programming history",
    "content": "\n          <p>No, nothing to do with eating Brussel sprouts. I was provoked this morning by reading about upcoming developments in Copilot AI inside GitHub (Microsoft), which would seem a natural match. It made me think how far we have come in my memory, and speculate where we will go to next. A.I. has moved so quickly that to me, just as I start to grok it, it morphs into something else, like the hydra, but maybe in a good way.</p>\n          <p>My first program was written in Secondary school in Mr. Copley’s class. Mr. Copley was famous for his R.E. classes so it was a little strange that he should pop up in the maths department. I had already learned some things from the Open University TV about Boolean logic, analogue v digital, simple programming languages like Basic and Algol, but I was yet to get the baptism of running my first program.</p>\n          <p>The teacher gave us the basic outline, and demonstrated how Fortran did its thing with some examples. Then we were told to get out our notebooks and write a simple program. Next lesson, we got some punch cards and a magnetic pencil and converted each symbol into three marks in every column. This was sent away somewhere and returned together with a printout of the code. I don’t remember a hand punch entering the loop anywhere. Long story short I eventually got the output from my program. For the record it was calculating various scenarios of the taps and baths problem. It worked!</p>\n          <p>There I left it, through 6th form nothing. University, nothing. Post Grad, back to Fortran, a bit of PDP assembler, and some interactive Basic. Never saw a graphic terminal till someone in a lab acquired a Commodore Pet. It played poker.</p>\n          <p>Eventually I got a job and became a Junior Programmer. 25 or so years in the industry, partly as a contractor, I was able to see how it evolved from close up. The PC was a new thing, which I didn’t acquire for many years, but I saw technologies, languages, paradigms come and go. Languages included Cobol, Dibol, Fortran, C, C++, Basic and a few oddballs. I loved it. I would make sure to get my copy of Byte every month, got an AOL account. The days of buying a book, or a bit of software then emailing the author and expecting a reply.</p>\n          <p>Now for A.I. It seemed at first to be something I didn’t understand that people used to make funny photos and present them to you. It was quite a buzz, and the rise of the chatbots—whether the proverbial Mother or Grandmother is using ChatGPT on a regular basis, I think not.</p>\n          <p>The news today enthusing about what the beta versions of the GitHub Copilot team could do left me a bit stunned.</p>\n          <p>Over to Grok.</p>\n          <p class=\"has-small-font-size\">GitHub is home to over 420 million repositories as of late 2024, hosting code written by more than 150 million users. These repositories contain an immense volume of code across countless programming languages, frameworks, and projects. While GitHub doesn’t publicly disclose the exact number of lines of code stored on its platform, we can make an educated guess based on available data and trends.</p>\n          <p class=\"has-small-font-size\">A single moderately sized repository might contain anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of lines of code, while large projects—like open-source frameworks or enterprise software—can easily exceed millions of lines. For instance, the Linux kernel alone has over 30 million lines of code. If we conservatively assume an average of 10,000 lines per repository (accounting for both small scripts and larger projects), multiplying that by 420 million repositories gives us a rough estimate of 4.2 trillion lines of code on GitHub. This is likely an underestimate, as many repositories are far larger, and GitHub’s growth continues to accelerate.</p>\n          <p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Copilot, however, wasn’t trained on every single line of code in every GitHub repository. It was developed using a subset of publicly available code, filtered and processed by OpenAI to create its underlying model, Codex. This training data includes billions of lines of code from public GitHub repositories, though the exact figure isn’t disclosed. Research and industry reports suggest that large language models like Codex are trained on datasets containing tens to hundreds of billions of lines of code, drawn not just from GitHub but also from other public sources like Stack Overflow and open-source archives. Given GitHub’s dominance as the largest code hosting platform, it’s reasonable to estimate that Copilot’s training data includes at least 50 to 100 billion lines of code from GitHub alone.</p>\n          <p>Back to me. Seems that Copilot and GitHub could be used to maybe develop improved AI models, or at least improve the GitHub codebase in general. This is synergistic so this feels like a hockey stick moment in time. The singularity is near, or maybe it’s already here.</p>\n          <p>I’ll leave you with a song.</p>\n        ",
