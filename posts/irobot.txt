I, Robot and the Movie That Wasn't
I paid my ticket and went with great anticipation to the local cinema in Mexico to see the much-talked-about film I, Robot, starring Will Smith. This was perhaps the movie I‚Äôd been waiting for for 20 years. A cinematic reckoning with the great themes of robotics, perhaps in the mold of 2001: A Space Odyssey or Blade Runner‚Äîphilosophical, weighty, poetic. Or maybe even something wild like Total Recall or Robocop, full of satire and subversion.

What I got instead... was something else.

üé¨ Blockbuster vs. Book
I, Robot was released in North America on July 16, 2004, and made $52.2 million in its opening weekend, ultimately pulling in over $347 million worldwide. It was a hit. But as for its resemblance to the Asimov collection‚Äîapart from the title and a thin reference to Dr. Susan Calvin‚Äîit was mostly a slick detective thriller, wrapped in early 2000s CGI wizardry.

It had chases, crashes, quips, and a menacing humanoid villain, sure. But it lacked what I had longed for: a deep dive into the complexity of the 3 Laws of Robotics, the paradoxes, the moral knots Asimov so carefully unraveled in stories like Liar! and The Evitable Conflict.

ü§ñ Out of Sync
Watching I, Robot in a Mexican cinema in 2004 felt a bit like being the only person who‚Äôd read the book before seeing the film‚Äîexcept no one else even knew there was a book. Sci-fi here leaned more on spectacle than source material. People had seen The Matrix, Star Wars, The Fifth Element. But Asimov, Clarke, or Le Guin? You‚Äôd be lucky to find a yellowed paperback buried in a market stall.

There was no one to discuss the film‚Äôs philosophical near-miss with. No shared cultural touchstone. Just the buzz of the popcorn machine and the flicker of CGI stunts. It felt... lonely.

üìú The Laws That Echo
Back then, robots were still pure science fiction‚Äîno one truly believed they‚Äôd arrive any time soon. But for those of us steeped in the genre, Asimov‚Äôs famous Three Laws had long since become universal:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Wikipedia now lists six. The fact that they read like contemporary AI policy proposals rather than dusty fiction is telling.

üç≥ The Future Arrived in the Kitchen
And now‚Äî2025. Elon Musk unveils his Optimus prototype. Google demonstrates household robots calmly frying eggs. Boston Dynamics robots do parkour and backflips. They don‚Äôt look like fiction anymore‚Äîthey look like interns.

Seeing those demos is surreal. The grand future of robotics didn‚Äôt arrive in gleaming spaceports or rebel colonies. It arrived with dish towels and frying pans.

üîÅ Time for a Reboot?
In hindsight, I, Robot the movie wasn't a betrayal‚Äîit was a product of its time. Action reigned, and philosophical nuance didn‚Äôt sell popcorn. But maybe now, with robots at our doorstep and AI in our pockets, we‚Äôre finally ready for Asimov‚Äôs questions. The ones about conscience, control, and what it truly means to obey.

Perhaps the movie that really explores those ideas hasn‚Äôt been made yet. Or maybe it's already happening‚Äîin essays, in podcasts, in quiet conversations about sentience and responsibility.

It might be time for a reboot. One not just of I, Robot, but of how we tell stories about the future we‚Äôre already living.

Let me know if you'd like a trimmed version for microblogging, a title series if you're turning this into a multi-post thread, or some cover image ideas for flair.
