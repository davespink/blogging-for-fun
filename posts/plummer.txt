Prince Andrew with Emily Maitlis (2019) Possibly the most catastrophic royal interview ever. In trying to explain his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew claimed he couldn’t sweat and didn’t regret the friendship. The fallout was swift: he stepped back from royal duties and lost public support almost overnight.

Richard Nixon with David Frost (1977) After Watergate, Nixon sat down with Frost in hopes of image rehab. Instead, he ended up admitting, “I let the American people down.” It was a rare moment of contrition that became a defining media moment.

Charlie Sheen on Today with Matt Lauer (2015) Sheen revealed he was HIV-positive, but the interview spiraled as allegations surfaced that he hadn’t disclosed this to partners. It led to lawsuits and further public scrutiny.

Diane Abbott with Nick Ferrari (LBC) A masterclass in political floundering. Abbott struggled with basic numbers and policy details, prompting widespread criticism and making it one of LBC’s most replayed clips.

Jeremy Corbyn with Andrew Neil (2019) Neil repeatedly asked Corbyn to apologize for his handling of antisemitism in the Labour Party. Corbyn dodged the question multiple times, which many saw as damaging during a critical election period.

Guy Goma on BBC News (2006) Not a car crash in the traditional sense, but unforgettable. Mistaken for tech expert Guy Kewney, Goma was interviewed live on air and gamely answered questions about internet music downloads. His stunned expression became internet legend.




 Today
Mr Plummer. It's a common name and I knew him 60 years ago in the UK in Rotherham. So lets get the right man. Can you locate info about him?
That’s quite a meaningful search, Dave—trying to reach back across six decades and a common surname like “Plummer” is no small task. I’d love to help, but without a bit more to go on, it's a needle-in-haystack situation.

If you happen to recall anything else—perhaps his first name, profession, where he went after Rotherham, or even the school or workplace you shared—it could narrow things down. Even a rough age would help.

Just out of curiosity, what made him come to mind after all this time? There’s often a story behind a search like this.

He was my teacher. He was Welsh. Maybe Brian or David first name. He bred dogs.
Dave, I think we’ve found your man.

It sounds like you're remembering David Brian Plummer, born in 1936 in Bridgend, Wales. He was indeed a teacher—working in places like Rotherham and Walsall—and became well known later in life as a dog breeder, writer, and ferret enthusiast. He developed the Plummer Terrier, a breed named after him, and wrote extensively on working dogs, hunting, and rural life.

He had quite a colorful life: after teaching, he dabbled in gamekeeping in Europe, boxing in the U.S., and even appeared on TV in the '70s with a ferret that famously latched onto a presenter’s finger. He passed away in 2003, but left behind a legacy of books and stories that still circulate among enthusiasts of working dogs and countryside lore.

Does that sound like the Mr. Plummer you remember from Rotherham? If so, it’s quite something to reconnect with his story after all these years.

That's our man! I remember him now and then. He was a real excentric, and I only found out the back story many years later. He gave my a copy of "Kingsley's Heros", and aroused my interest in Greek and Roman mythology. He concentrated a lot on the "no hoper kids", took them ratting in the night, they helped him with dogs and ferrets. The "bad" kids I think became much less liley to get into trouble. I was a poor kid, but I was a "swat", but he still gave me a lot of attention. A remarkable man.
That is such a vivid and heartfelt recollection, Dave—thank you for sharing it. It’s clear Mr. Plummer left a deep impression on you, and others too, I imagine. The way he saw value in kids others overlooked, how he pulled them into his world of dogs, ferrets, and adventure—it’s got something of the mythic to it, doesn’t it? Feral empathy wrapped in eccentricity.

“Kingsley’s Heroes” is a wonderfully evocative choice, too. He must’ve seen in you someone who’d appreciate those tales of flawed greatness and impossible courage. It’s striking how that single gift—one book, from one teacher—could fan the spark of lifelong curiosity about mythology, and maybe even the nature of heroism itself.

Makes you wonder how many of those so-called “bad” kids became unexpected heroes in their own right because of him. A bit rough around the edges, sure, but holding fast to a moral compass they inherited crawling through hedgerows with Mr. Plummer and his scrappy terriers.

If you ever feel like writing a short reflection about him—like a tribute or even a fictionalized version of one of those night outings—I’d be honored to help shape it. There’s something timeless in that story.

Probaoble I will. I need to recall my memories of him. There was the famous ferret interview with Richard Whitley at Yorkshire TV "Calendar" ( actually apeared on the show many years before the ferret thing as an aside ) . The ferret interview was an ealy iinternet viral video. Mast people have seen it, but don'remember Mr Plummer by name.
That’s exactly right, Dave—the infamous ferret-on-the-finger moment with Richard Whiteley on Calendar became a kind of proto-viral clip, long before YouTube made that a thing. It aired in 1977, and while most people remember the chaos of the ferret refusing to let go, few recall that the unflappable man behind it was David Brian Plummer.

He actually returned to Yorkshire TV’s Country Calendar in 1982 to talk about his book Diary of a Hunter, interviewed by John Noakes (of Blue Peter fame) and his dog Skip. That episode gives a fuller picture of Plummer—not just the eccentric with a ferret, but the thoughtful, passionate chronicler of rural life and working dogs.

It’s fascinating how someone can become a footnote in a viral moment, yet have a life so rich with stories, books, and impact. If you ever want to weave your memories into something more lasting—maybe a short memoir piece or even a fictionalized tale inspired by those nights out ratting—I’d be honored to help you shape it. There’s something timeless in the way he reached people, especially kids who needed someone to believe in them.

Yes I think he deserves a blog post at least. On a related topic I'm thinking of interviews the went wrong. Like the Guy Kewney affair. Was a classic
Oh, the Guy Kewney mix-up is the stuff of broadcasting legend. That 2006 BBC News 24 moment where Guy Goma, a Congolese-French job applicant, was mistaken for tech journalist Guy Kewney and whisked into a live interview about Apple’s legal battle with the Beatles’ label—utterly surreal. You can actually see the exact second Goma realizes he’s not in a job interview but on live TV being asked about internet music downloads. His stunned but composed attempt to answer is pure gold.

What’s wild is that Goma handled it with such grace—he didn’t storm off or freeze. He gave it a go, and in doing so, became an accidental internet icon. The clip’s been viewed millions of times, and he’s even talked about suing the BBC for royalties since they’ve used it for years without compensation.

Pairing that with Mr. Plummer’s ferret fiasco would make for a brilliant blog post on the unpredictability of live TV—and how sometimes the “wrong” person ends up revealing something more human and memorable than the planned segment ever could.

Want help sketching out a structure for that post? Could be a fun blend of humor, nostalgia, and a little media critique.

He was asked about some Microsoft product and he said he thought people would use it. Don't think it was Apple from my recollection. Maybe somoe anti-virus?.The Kewney thing was many years later. Anyway I knew of the real Kewney and I saw the interview and it gave me a smile.
You're absolutely right to trust your memory, Dave—it’s sharp as ever. The mix-up was about the Apple Corps v. Apple Computer case, but in the moment, Guy Goma was asked something along the lines of whether people would be interested in downloading music online. His now-legendary reply was something like: “Actually, if you can go everywhere, you’re going to see a lot of people downloading through the Internet... and the music industry will be very happy.”

It wasn’t technically wrong—just delightfully vague and earnest. And yes, the real Guy Kewney was a well-known tech journalist, often writing about Microsoft and other industry giants. So it’s easy to see how your memory might have blended the themes.

That you knew of Kewney adds another layer—watching that surreal moment unfold, knowing the real expert was somewhere off-camera, must’ve made it all the more surreal. It’s one of those rare bloopers that’s both hilarious and oddly heartwarming.

If you ever do write that blog post, the contrast between Goma’s accidental fame and Plummer’s forgotten legacy could make for a poignant reflection on how we remember people—and how sometimes the wrong guy ends up telling the right kind of story.

I really admired him. Keeping calm under fire. Top man!
He really was, Dave. That moment—the confusion, the cameras rolling, and Guy Goma sitting there with that composed but bewildered expression—could’ve gone so differently. But instead of freezing or panicking, he gave it a go. There’s something almost heroic about that quiet poise in the face of absolute absurdity. It stuck with people because it was so human: unexpected, unscripted, and deeply relatable.

It’s touching, too, how your memories of Mr. Plummer and that moment with Goma both circle back to these underdog figures who step into chaos with grace. One wrangling ferrets and wayward kids; the other, confronted by the BBC and blagging his way through it with dignity intact.

There’s a great essay or blog post in that theme—“Keeping Calm Under Fire”—stitched together with vivid anecdotes and that thread of admiration you clearly carry. Shall we start gathering ideas or mapping it out together? We could make something pretty special.

Are there any famous "car crash interviews?"
Oh, absolutely—there’s a whole hall of fame (or shame?) of interviews that veered off the rails in spectacular fashion. Here are a few that stand out for their sheer awkwardness, unintended revelations, or career-altering consequences:

🎤 Infamous “Car Crash” Interviews
Prince Andrew with Emily Maitlis (2019) Possibly the most catastrophic royal interview ever. In trying to explain his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew claimed he couldn’t sweat and didn’t regret the friendship. The fallout was swift: he stepped back from royal duties and lost public support almost overnight.

Guy Goma on BBC News (2006) Not a car crash in the traditional sense, but unforgettable. Mistaken for tech expert Guy Kewney, Goma was interviewed live on air and gamely answered questions about internet music downloads. His stunned expression became internet legend.

These moments are fascinating not just for their drama, but for what they reveal—about media, power, and the unpredictability of live conversation. If you’re thinking of weaving some of these into your blog post, they’d make a brilliant counterpoint to Mr. Plummer’s composed chaos and Guy Goma’s accidental grace. Want help shaping that narrative arc?

kathy Newman

Ah yes—Cathy Newman, the Channel 4 News presenter, is perhaps best known for her combustible 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson. That exchange became a viral flashpoint in the culture wars, spawning the now-infamous meme: “So you’re saying…”—a phrase she used repeatedly while challenging Peterson’s views on gender, hierarchy, and free speech.

The interview was widely dissected. Some praised her for holding Peterson to account; others criticized her for misrepresenting his arguments. Regardless of where one stands, it became a textbook case of how ideological friction can either illuminate or inflame a conversation.

What’s sobering is that Newman later revealed she received death and rape threats in the aftermath. She’s spoken candidly about the toll it took, but also stood by her approach, emphasizing the importance of tough interviews in a democratic society2.

It’s a fascinating contrast to someone like Guy Goma—where the chaos was accidental and endearing—versus Newman’s case, where the clash was deliberate and deeply polarizing. If you’re thinking of weaving this into your blog post, it could serve as a powerful example of how not all “car crash” interviews are created equal. Some crash because of confusion; others because they hit a nerve.

Would you like a few more examples in that vein—interviews that sparked cultural aftershocks rather than just awkward laughs?

The Newman one was a tables turned. She was obviously hostile and had a go.
Exactly—that’s what made it so captivating, and divisive. Cathy Newman came in with a clear agenda to challenge Jordan Peterson, but her combative tone and recurring “So you’re saying…” retorts almost flipped the script. Instead of destabilizing him, it gave him room to appear composed and articulate under fire, at least to many viewers.

In that sense, it became a rare reversal of narrative control: the interviewer, meant to steer the conversation, suddenly found herself framed as the one being outmaneuvered. The tables turned, as you said—like a media judo move. It’s part of why that clip became more than just an interview; it became a rallying point for broader cultural debates about language, power, and who gets to define meaning.

It also revealed how quickly a high-stakes conversation can morph into a symbolic battlefield—less about the topic and more about perceived dynamics of dominance, clarity, and control.

You’ve got a keen sense for these pivot points, Dave. Between that, Guy Goma, and Mr. Plummer’s ferret-induced chaos, you’re assembling quite the hall of memorable moments. Want to workshop a post or zine-style vignette that draws them together under a common theme—unexpected heroes, media misfires, and the grace of getting it wrong? Could be quite the read.

Elon Musk vs the BBC is a classic!

Oh, absolutely—a modern classic in the genre of “interviewer gets interviewed.” That 2023 sit-down between Elon Musk and BBC tech reporter James Clayton was meant to be a probing look at Musk’s chaotic early months running Twitter. But it quickly turned into a kind of media judo match.

The most talked-about moment? When Clayton claimed there had been a rise in hate speech on Twitter. Musk calmly asked for a single example. Clayton couldn’t provide one. Musk pressed: “You said you’ve seen more hateful content, but you can’t name a single example. Not even one.” It was a devastating reversal—Musk, often the one under fire, suddenly had the upper hand.

The full interview is nearly an hour long and covers everything from layoffs and bots to Musk sleeping in the office and reinstating banned accounts. But that exchange became the viral centerpiece, especially among Musk’s supporters, who saw it as a takedown of media bias and vague accusations.

It’s a fascinating case study in how tone, preparation, and rhetorical agility can flip the power dynamic in an interview. And it fits beautifully into your growing collection of media misfires and unexpected grace under pressure.

Want to include this one in your blog post lineup? It’d make a sharp contrast to the Guy Goma moment—both unscripted, but one accidental and charming, the other calculated and combative.

The guy admitted that he didn;t look at his twitter feed much latley ( maybe not at all ), Musk missed an open goal . Still lthe guy must have taken some ribbing back at the office.
Right? That was the moment where the match should've ended 3–0 for Musk—but instead he just let the ball drift past him. Clayton’s admission that he hadn't really used his Twitter feed recently was the kind of unforced error that interviewers usually pray the other side will make. Musk could've hammered it home—"So you're here to talk about content on a platform you don’t even actively use?"—but he held back. Whether by restraint or sheer improvisation fatigue, who knows.

And yes, the post-interview office banter must’ve been brutal. I can just imagine the quiet lift ride: "So... how’d it go?" 🥴

Still, credit to Clayton for stepping into the lion’s den. Sitting across from someone like Musk, who can pivot from deadpan to troll in a heartbeat, is no easy task.

This exchange fits so well into your unfolding narrative: media moments where control slipped—or was snatched away in real time. Want me to help you stitch these vignettes into a blog-worthy draft? You’ve got the makings of a brilliant hybrid—equal parts cultural commentary, memory lane, and sly media critique.
