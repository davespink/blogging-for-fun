                        remember when I first started blogging, it was a way to express myself and share my thoughts
                        with the
                        world. Now it seems that everyone is more interested in short videos and pictures than in
                        reading long
                        posts.</p>
                      <p>But I still love blogging. It allows me to think deeply about topics that interest me and share
                        my ideas
                        with others. I hope that one day people will return to blogging for fun, but until then, I will
                        continue to write for myself.</p>

                      <p>No, nothing to do with eating Brussel sprouts. I was provoked this morning by reading about
                        upcoming developments in Coplot AI inside GitHub ( Microsoft ), which would seem a natural
                        match. I made me think how far we have come in my memory, and speculate where we will go to
                        next. A.I. has moved so quicky that to me, just as I start to grok it, it morphs into
                        something else, like the hydra, but maybe in a good way.</p>
                      <p>My first program was written in Secondary school in Mr. Copley&#8217;s class. Mr. Copley was
                        famous for his R.E. classes so it was a little strange that he should pop up in the maths
                        department. I had already learned some things from the Open University TV about Boolean logic,
                        analogue v digital, simple programing languages like Basic and Algol, but I was yet to get the
                        baptism of running my first program.</p>



                      <p>The teacher give us the basic outline, and demonstrated how Fortran did its thing with some
                        examples. Then we were told to get out our notebooks and write a simple program. Next lesson,
                        we got some punch cards and a magnetic pencil and converted each symbol into three marks in
                        every column. This was sent away somewhere and returned together with a printout of the code.
                        I don&#8217;t remember a hand punch entering the loop anywhere. Long story short I eventually
                        got the output from my program. For the record it was calculating various scenarios or the
                        taps and baths problem. It worked!</p>



                      <p>There I left it, through 6th form nothing. University, nothing. Post Grad, back to Fortran,
                        a bit of PDP assembler, and some interactive Basic. Never saw a graphic terminal
                        till someone in a lab acquired a Commadore Pet. It played poker.</p>



                      <p>Eventually I got a job and became a Junior Programmer. 25 or so years in the industry, partly
                        as a
                        contractor, I was able see how it evolved from close up. The PC was a new thing, which I
                        didn&#8217;t
                        acquire from many years, but I saw technologies, languages, paradigms come and go. languages
                        included, Cobol, Dibol, Fortran, C, C++,Basic and a few odd balls. I loved it. I would make
                        sure to get my copy of Byte every month, got an AOL account. The days of buying a book, or a
                        bit of software then emailing the author and expecting a reply.</p>



                      <p>Now for A.I. It seemed at first to be something I didn&#8217;t understand that
                        people used to make funny photos and present them to you. It was quite a buzz, and the the
                        rise of the chatbots whether the proverbial Mother or Grandmother is using Chat GPT on a
                        regular basis, I think not.</p>



                      <p>The news today enthusing about what the beta versions of the GitHub,
                        Copilot team could do left me a bit stunned.</p>



                      <p>Over to Grok.</p>



                      <p class="has-small-font-size">GitHub is home to over 420 million repositories as of late 2024,
                        hosting code
                        written by more than 150 million users. These repositories contain an immense volume of code
                        across countless
                        programming languages, frameworks, and projects. While GitHub doesn’t publicly disclose the
                        exact number of lines of code stored on its platform, we can make an educated guess based on
                        available data and trends.</p>



                      <p class="has-small-font-size">A single moderately sized repository might contain anywhere
                        from a few thousand to tens of thousands of lines of code, while large projects—like
                        open-source
                        frameworks or enterprise software—can easily exceed millions of lines. For instance, the Linux
                        kernel
                        alone has over 30 million lines of code. If we conservatively assume an average of 10,000
                        lines per
                        repository (accounting for both small scripts and larger projects), multiplying that by 420
                        million
                        repositories gives us a rough estimate of 4.2 trillion lines of code on GitHub. This is likely
                        an
                        underestimate, as many repositories are far larger, and GitHub’s growth continues to
                        accelerate.</p>



                      <p class="has-small-font-size">Copilot, however, wasn’t trained on every single line of code in
                        every GitHub repository.
                        It was developed using a subset of publicly available code, filtered and processed by OpenAI
                        to create its underlying model,
                        Codex. This training data includes billions of lines of code from public GitHub repositories,
                        though the exact
                        figure isn’t disclosed. Research and industry reports suggest that large language models like
                        Codex are trained on datasets
                        containing tens to hundreds of billions of lines of code, drawn not just from GitHub but also
                        from other public sources
                        like Stack Overflow and open-source archives. Given GitHub’s dominance as the largest code
                        hosting platform, it’s
                        reasonable to estimate that Copilot’s training data includes at least 50 to 100 billion lines
                        of code from GitHub alone.</p>


                      <p>Back to me. Seems that Copilot and GitHub could be used to maybe develop improved AI models,
                        or at least
                        improve the GitHub codebase in general. This is synergistic so this feels like a hockey stick
                        moment in time.
                        The singularity is near, or maybe it&#8217;s already here.</p>


                      <p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a song.</p>

                      In an earlier post I alluded to the names of our border collie dogs, the senior of which is
                      Sheba. She was
                      so named after an old dog of my mother’s, but in turn this dog was named for a Hollywood Movie
                      “Come Back,
                      Little Sheba”. Sheba disappears months before the start of the film and never appears. It is
                      implied that
                      Sheba is presumed dead. It stars Burt Lancaster, and Shirley Booth, who got a Best Actress Oscar
                      in 1953 for
                      it. I began to wonder if there is a term for such characters and yes Gemini. informed me thus

                      Yes, there is! That type of character is called an offstage character or an unseen character.
                      </p>
                      These characters are important to the plot and the development of other characters,
                      even though the audience never actually sees them. They might be mentioned in dialogue,
                      have actions attributed to them, or even influence the events of the play.
                      </p>
                      Here are some examples of famous offstage characters:

                      Godot in “Waiting for Godot”: The title character is the most famous example of an offstage
                      character, whose
                      unseen presence drives the entire play.
                      Mr. Wickham’s father in “Pride and Prejudice”: While the character of Mr. Wickham is onstage,
                      his father,
                      who worked for Mr. Darcy’s father, is only mentioned in dialogue. However, the elder Mr.
                      Wickham’s past
                      relationship with the Darcy family is crucial to understanding Wickham’s motivations.
                      Rose’s fiancé in “The Importance of Being Earnest”: Though never seen, Cecily’s imaginary
                      betrothed, Ernest,
                      plays a significant role in the comedic plot.
                      Offstage characters can serve a variety of purposes, such as:

                      <img src="https://w3schools.com/w3images/lights.jpg"
                        style="width:30%; float: left; margin-right: 15px;">

                      </p>
                      Creating intrigue and suspense: The audience might wonder about their identity or motivations.
                      Developing other characters: Interactions with or discussions about the unseen character can
                      reveal traits
                      and
                      motivations of the onstage characters.
                      Advancing the plot: Their actions, though offstage, can drive the events of the play.
                      Now as to Godot , it is a reworking by Samuel Beckett of his original work in French En
                      attendant Godot.

                      It is alleged that originally Godot was meant to appear half way through the play, but the actor
                      playing
                      Godot
                      failed to appear and so the two characters, Vladimir and Estragon were left to adlib the rest of
                      the play.
                      True? I doubt it but I would love it to be so.

                      Adding to the AI effort I can think of Mr Papadopoulos, in Coronation Street who is referred to
                      by Mr
                      Swindley
                      ( Arthur Lowe ). Papadopoulos is a greek clothing magnate who owns Miami Modes. Swindley is the
                      manager.

                      Again Arthur Lowe in Dad’s Army, Mrs Mannering is never seen.
                      </p>
                      Google gives us

                      King Laius in Oedipus Rex: An offstage character in Sophocles’s play who is a driving force for
                      action
                      Jason’s bride in Medea: An offstage character in Euripides’s play
                      Rosaline in Romeo and Juliet: An offstage character in Shakespeare’s play who highlights the
                      predicament of
                      the two lovers
                      Off stage characters also exists in books ( again AI gives us )

                      Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird”: Boo is a recluse who never leaves his house, but his
                      presence looms
                      large over the novel. He becomes a source of fascination and fear for the children, and his
                      actions
                      ultimately
                      save Jem and Scout.

                      Mrs. Haverford in “Rebecca”: The deceased first wife of Maxim de Winter, Rebecca is a powerful
                      offstage
                      character whose presence haunts the narrator and Manderley. Her influence shapes the entire
                      plot, even
                      though
                      she is already dead.

                      Snape’s mother in the “Harry Potter” series: Eileen Prince, Severus Snape’s mother, is only
                      mentioned in
                      passing and through memories, but her difficult relationship with his father and her magical
                      abilities are
                      crucial to understanding Snape’s character and motivations.

                      I would add that in 1984 O’Brien plays a major part in the narrative, but it is unsure that he
                      actually
                      exists.

                      For most of Atlas Shrugged we are unsure if John Galt exists, even though he drives the plot. (
                      yes, he
                      appears, after a few 1000 pages 😉 ).

                      That’s about it, but if you can think of any I’ve missed please leave a comment. Ta.
